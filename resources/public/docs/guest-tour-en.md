When we write correctly, we don't recall all the grammer and spelling rules, we just feel what's right. We've heard, read and seen a huge amount of examples of that phrase usages, and "feel" how it should be written and pronounced.

This works exactly the same with a foreign language. You have to listen to thousands of English phrases, spoken by native speaker to have a feeling of those phrases sounding right. And then you will write and speak fluently. And you will be able to listen even before that.

We've sorted the phrases in such a manner that course will start with the most commonly ones used in TV shows and movies. That's a start. The further you go, the less common phrases and words you'll encounter.


At the very beginning, you'll understand only some of the sentences' parts. Then some phrases wholly. And then the missing phrases and words from the context.

After you log into the system, you'll see the first phrase offered for learning in the left column. Phrase has word/phrases links (underscored) and a translation to the language of your choice.

The phrases or words you haven't searched for yet are marked with bold underscore. Click on the link, and you'll be presented with a video-fragment containing that phrase. When you're done, the underscore will disappear.

Don't try to get the whose phrase from the video in the beginning of the course, this is the matter of time. You main task for now is to learn how to catch a single word combination. The search phrase from the video fragment is underscored for your convenience.

When the bold underscore for all the words available is gone, you can proceed to the next one, clicking the white right arrow.
